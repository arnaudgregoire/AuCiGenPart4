## Introduction

AuCiGen (Automated City Generation) is a global project which is composed of 5 subproject. The topic of our part was "Procedural Generation of Parcels in Urban Modelling". During 4 weeks, we implemented 2 algorithms modelising realistic partitioning in parcels :

- the first one based on the minimum oriented bounding box
- the second one based on the straight skeleton
