Au\+Ci\+Gen (Automated City Generation) is a global project which is composed of 5 subproject. The topic of our part was \char`\"{}\+Procedural Generation of Parcels in Urban Modelling\char`\"{}. During 4 weeks, we implemented 2 algorithms modelising realistic partitioning in parcels \+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item the first one based on the minimum oriented bounding box
\item the second one based on the straight skeleton
\end{DoxyItemize}
